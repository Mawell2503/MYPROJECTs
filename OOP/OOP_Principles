# !3rd Projects
1.Abstraction
    ~Focus on what an object does, not how it does it
        #Pressing "start" on a car without knowing/caring how the engine works

2.Encapsulating
    ~Wrapping data + methods together and protecting them
        #Your bank account -> you cant directly change the balance

3.Inheritance
    ~A class getting properties and method from another class
        #A student is a person

4.Polymorphism
    ~Same method name, differnet behaviour
        #The word "move" works differnetly for car(drives), bird(flies), human(walk)

# !1st Project
1.Single Responsibility Principles(SRP)
    ~A class should do one job ONLY.
        #Class(multiplier) should only multiply integers, not: type conversion, input validation, etc
        ##Creating a class that has one and not multiple purposes

2.Open/Closed Principle(OCP)
    ~It allows you to add new behaviour without rewriting old code
        #Class(Square) should be able to utilise area() from class(rectangle) that has method area.
        ##Creating a behaviour(method) from a class that can be utilised in other class.

3.Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
    ~Wherever the child is expected so should the parent be.
    ~basically: LSP is the understanding that a child class should never change what the parent classs does?
        - a parent class defines a contract. and the child class shouldnt break that contract.
            - a child class shouldnt 1.remove behaviour 2.chnage the meaning of the method 3. add stricter rule than what the parent has throw new errors.

4.Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
    ~basically: dont force a class to implement methods that it doesnt necessarily need.

5.Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

# !2nd Project

1.Aggregation (the process of gathering, combining, or collecting seperate parts)
    ~A "whole-part" (whole = class) (part = instances) relationship, but the part can exist independently of the whole.
        #A library has a books, but a book can exist even if the library is destroyed
        ##Creating an object(another class) that can be used in a class and can be used outside of it.

2.Composition (puttting together)
    ~A strong "whole-part" relationship, where the part cannot exist without the whole
        #A room cannot exist without a house. If the house is demolished, the rooms are gone too.
        ##Creating an object that doesnt exist without its class

3.Association in OOP (being united)
    ~A general relationship between two classes where one class "uses" or "knows about" another.
        #A teacher teaches students, but a teacher can exist without students, and a students can exist without a teacher.
        ##Creating a class that works with another class but none owns the other.

4.Cohesion (sticking together/forming a united whole)
    ~How closely related and focused the responsibilies of a single class/module are.
        #A class(Car) that handles: 1.engine operations 2.steering 3.braking(they are cohesive)
        #A class(Car) that handles: 1.steering 2.networking 3.logging 4. engine(unrelated/not cohesive)
        ##Creating a class that has one character.

5.Coupling (joining/connecting)
    ~How dependant one class/module is on another, They should not.
        #Class(A) calls multiple methods of class(B) and relies on class(B)
        #Classs(A) interacts with class(B) only via simple interface,so changes in B don't break A.
        ##Creating independent classes that doesnt rely on one another.
